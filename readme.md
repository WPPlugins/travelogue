travelogue
==========

Travelogue is a WordPress plugin for travel bloggers. It allows users to add location information to posts and display the most blogged-about places in a widget. 


What it does now:
-----------------

* Allows a user to add geolocation information to posts. (Limited to cities)
* Provides a widget that lists the most blogged about cities.
* Provide a page that lists all posts associated with a particular city.


What it will do very soon:
--------------------------

* Provide a widget that lets a user specify the city they are in currently.


What it will do pretty soon:
-----------------------------

* Add google maps to posts and widgets. 
* Allow a user to associate more than one city with a post. 
* Allow a user to add a list of their favorite cities and display that in a widget. 


What it will eventually do:
----------------------------

* Extend geolocation info to include more than cities.
* A map page showing favorite/frequent/or all destinations. 
* Alternate APIs.


Ideas I'm not really committed to:
----------------------------------

* Ability to append resturant/hotel recommendations to pages and posts associated with a particular place.
